How not to go against me, smart<br>And it's absurd how people hang on every word<br>I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve<br>But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved<br>If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first<br>'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse<br>That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse<br>My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict<br>I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers<br>But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles<br>The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers<br>So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em<br>The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?<br>'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters<br>A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so<br><br>'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<br>'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?
