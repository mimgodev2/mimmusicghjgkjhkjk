They're trying to tell me how to feel<br>This love is difficult but it's real<br>Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess<br>It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.&quot;<br><br>Oh, oh, oh<br><br>I got tired of waiting<br>Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>My faith in you was fading<br>When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>And I said<br><br>&quot;Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone<br>I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.&quot;<br>He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said<br><br>&quot;Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone<br>I love you, and that's all I really know<br>I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress<br>It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.&quot;<br><br>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br><br>'Cause we were both young when I first saw you</font></p>"
